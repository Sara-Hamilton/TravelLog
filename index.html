            I visited France in September of 2013 as part of a Rick Steves' Best of Europe in 14 Days Tour. In Paris, we rode an elevator to the top of the Eiffel Tower. The view of the city from the top of the tower is magnificent. Paris is full of museums. The
            Louvre is the largest museum in the world. It is home to <cite>Mona Lisa</cite> and <cite>Venus de Milo</cite>. In Paris, we toured Saint-Chapelle and marveled at the intricate stained glass windows. Seeing Notre-Dame Cathedral
            lit up in the evening from a riverboat floating down the Seine was one of my favorite memories from this trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            The food in France is excellent. We dined on duck confit, french onion soup, and escargot. The croissants in France are delicious. I have not been able to find a croissant in the United States that compares with those in France. A fresh croissant and
            a small cup of coffee make an excellent breakfast.

            I visited Germany in September of 2013 as part of a Rick Steves' Best of Europe in 14 Days Tour. Munich is home to many impressive museums. My favorite was the New Pinakothek where we saw many paintings by Van Gogh, Picasso, and Monet. While in Bavaria,we
            toured a beer hall where regulars have their own tables. You can get invited to share a table with them if you play your cards right. We ate dinner in a beer garden one evening where people all sit very close to each other at long picnic tables.
            It was quite a communal experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The food in Germany is very meat heavy. They are known for their sausages. I found myself craving a salad after eating here for a few days. Bavarian pretzels with chcoclate hazlenut spread make an excellent breakfast.

            I visited Italy in September of 2013 as part of a Rick Steves' Best of Europe in 14 Days Tour. We walked through the cobblestone streets of Venice and rode in a gondola through the canals. We also visited Florence where they sold nice Italian leather
            goods for good prices at the market. In Florence, we toured the Uffizi Museum where we saw Botticelli's <cite>The Birth of Venus</cite>. We also visited Rome where our tour guide explained to us that Rome was built like a lasagna.
            There are many layers stacked upon each other. The ancient architecture is preserved while new buildings have been erected around them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The food in Italy is delicious. We dined on homemade pasta and fresh seafood. Limonata gelato became my new favorite desert when I was there.

            I visited Croatia in May of 2015 as part of a Rick Steves' Best of the Adriatic in 14 Days Tour. Croatia is a beautiful country on the Adriatic Sea that has a history of war as recently as the 1990s. My favorite memory of Croatia is walking the ramparts
            of Dubrovnik. I also enjoyed visiting Plitvice Lakes National Park. Plitvice Park is filled with cascading waterfalls that tourists walk through and around on wooden pathways. It is like walking through a magical forest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The food in Croatia is great. I especially enjoyed Buzara shrimp. This is a bowl full of shrimp in a tasty, rich wine and tomato based sauce. In Istria, we had Istrian black truffles with homemade pasta. It was delicious.

            I visited Belize in March of 2017 with my family. We spent half of our time in the jungle and half of our time in the cayes near the ocean. We crossed the border to Guatemala and toured the ancient Mayan ruins of Tikal. We also toured the
            <abbr title="Actun Tunichil Muknal">ATM</abbr> caves. The tour was a great adventure that involved swimming, climbing, and manuvering through tight spaces. There are many artifacts in the caves including ancient Mayan pottery and human skeletons.
            After spending some time in the jungle, we flew to Ambergris Caye in a very tiny plane. We enjoyed spending time on the beach. We took a catamaran tour that involved fishing and snorkeling with nurse sharks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The food in Belize is delicious and nutritious. Beans and Rice are a common staple. Fried plantains make a delicious side dish. Conch fritters and fresh fish can be found in abundance. Caye Lime pie is a common dessert item.

            I visited Peru in September of 2017 with a tour company called G Adventures. We saw caimen, piranhas, and macaws in the Amazon jungle. We hiked the Inca Trail, which is 26 miles long, over the course of 3 1/2 days. We also visited Lake Titicaca and met
            indigenous people who live on the lake on floating islands made out of reeds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The food in peru consists of many grains, such as quinoa, and fresh vegetables, such as potatoes. Soups and juices are very popular there. This is probably due to the fact that the water is unsafe to drink unless it has been boiled. Guinea Pig is considered
            to be a delicacy. This dish is called Cuy.

                <li>When shopping for items made of Llama or Alpaca hair, genuine items will feel cool to the touch.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>Coaca leaves are very popular in Peru. They are often available as a tea or candy. It is believed that they can help ease altitude sickness.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>If you plan on hiking the Inca Trail, book with a tour company early. Passes are limited, and they sell out months in advance.</li>

            I visited the Galapagos Islands in October of 2017 as part of a boat tour with G Adventures. The Islands are formed from volcanos and are filled with interesting wildlife ranging from blue-footed boobies to iguanas to sealions. The Galapagos Islands are
            a good place to snorkel. We saw hammerhead sharks, sea turtles, and many different types of fish. One day at sea, our boat was surrounded by thousands of bottlenose dolphins.

            The food in the Galapagos Islands consists of many soups and vegetable dishes. The fresh seafood is excellent. Ceviche is served with popcorn.

              <ul>
                <li>If you stay on a boat, you can sleep while the boat travels from island to island. This makes travel times short, but the rocking of the ocean can be disorienting.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>You can stay in a hotel on stable land, but then the rides to each island take more time.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>This is a good place to have GoPro or some other type of underwater camera. There is as much to see in the water as there is on the land.</li>
