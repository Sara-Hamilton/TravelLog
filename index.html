                <p>I visited France in September of 2013 as part of a Rick Steves' Best of Europe in 14 Days Tour. In Paris, we rode an elevator to the top of the Eiffel Tower. The view of the city from the top of the tower is magnificent. Paris is full
                    of museums. The Louvre is the largest museum in the world. It is home to <cite>Mona Lisa</cite> and <cite>Venus de Milo</cite>. In Paris, we toured Saint-Chapelle and marveled at the intricate stained glass windows. Seeing Notre-Dame
                    Cathedral lit up in the evening from a riverboat floating down the Seine was one of my favorite memories from this trip.</p>
                <p>The food in France is excellent. We dined on duck confit, french onion soup, and escargot. The croissants in France are delicious. I have not been able to find a croissant in the United States that compares with those in France. A fresh
                    croissant and a small cup of coffee make an excellent breakfast.</p>

                        <li>Shoplifting is part of the culture in Europe. Keep your money, passport, and credit cards in a money belt underneath your clothes.</li>
                        <li>Admission to most museums, including the Louvre, Muse&#x301;e d'Orsay, and Centre Pompidou is free on the first Sunday of every month.</li>

                <p>I visited Germany in September of 2013 as part of a Rick Steves' Best of Europe in 14 Days Tour. Munich is home to many impressive museums. My favorite was the New Pinakothek where we saw many paintings by Van Gogh, Picasso, and Monet.
                    While in Bavaria,we toured a beer hall where regulars have their own tables. You can get invited to share a table with them if you play your cards right. We ate dinner in a beer garden one evening where people all sit very close to
                    each other at long picnic tables. It was quite a communal experience.</p>
                <p>The food in Germany is very meat heavy. They are known for their sausages. I found myself craving a salad after eating here for a few days. Bavarian pretzels with chcoclate hazlenut spread make an excellent breakfast.</p>

                <p>I visited Italy in September of 2013 as part of a Rick Steves' Best of Europe in 14 Days Tour. We walked through the cobblestone streets of street of Venice and rode in a gondola through the canals. We also visited Florence where they
                    sold nice Italian leather goods for good prices at the market. In Florence, we toured the Uffizi Museum where we saw Botticelli's <cite>The Birth of Venus</cite>. We also visited Rome where our tour guide explained to us that Rome
                    was built like a lasagna. There are many layers stacked upon each other. The ancient architecture is preserved while new buildings have been erected around them.</p>
                <p>The food in Italy is delicious. We dined on homemade pasta and fresh seafood. Limonata gelato became my new favorite desert when I was there.</p>

                        <li>If possible, try to visit Venice when there are no or few cruise ships in port. The number of tourists in Venice changes dramatically depending on the cruise ships. You can check cuise ship schedules <a href="http://ports.cruisett.com/schedule/Italy/733-Venice">here</a>.</li>
                        <li>If you decide to go to the top of the bell tower in St. Mark's square in Venice, try to not be at the top when the bells are ringing. It is rather loud.</li>

                <p>I visited Croatia in May of 2015 as part of a Rick Steves' Best of the Adriatic in 14 Days Tour. Croatia is a beautiful country on the Adriatic Sea that has a history of war as recently as the 1990s. My favorite memory of Croatia is walking
                    the ramparts of Dubrovnik. I also enjoyed visiting Plitvice Lakes National Park. Plitvice Park is filled with cascading waterfalls that tourists walk through and around on wooden pathways. It is like walking through a magical forest.</p>
                <p>The food in Croatia is great. I especially enjoyed Buzara shrimp. This is a bowl full of shrimp in a tasty, rich wine and tomato based sauce. In Istria, we had Istrian black truffles with homemade pasta. It was delicious.</p>

                <p>I visited Belize in March of 2017 with my family. We spent half of our time in the jungle and half of our time in the cayes near the ocean. We crossed the border to Guatemala and toured the ancient Mayan ruins of Tikal. We also toured
                    the <abbr title="Actun Tunichil Muknal">ATM</abbr> caves. The tour was a great adventure that involved swimming, climbing, and manuvering through tight spaces. There are many artifacts in the caves including ancient Mayan pottery and
                    human skeletons. After spending some time in the jungle, we flew to Ambergris Caye in a very tiny plane. We enjoyed spending time on the beach. We took a catamaran tour that involved fishing and snorkeling with nurse sharks.</p>
                <p>The food in Belize is delicious and nutritious. Beans and Rice are a common staple. Fried plantains make a delicious side dish. Conch fritters and fresh fish can be found in abundance. Caye Lime pie is a common dessert item.</p>
